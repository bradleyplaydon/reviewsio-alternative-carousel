# reviewsio-alternative-carousel
  Reviews IO carousel embed widgets load in Iframes to load there "Widgets" into your page the only issue this causes is that these widgets require jQuery which means if you want multiple widget type sections on your page this will duplicate jQuery causing more HTTP requests, Higher page size where it may not be needed if your site already used jQuery.

*This consumes the ReviewsIO API to output a JS/HTML carousel which shows company stats pulled from the API calls.*
